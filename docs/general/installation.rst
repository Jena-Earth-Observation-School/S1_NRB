SNAP
----

S1_NRB requires ESAâ€™s Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP) software to produce S1-NRB products. It has been developed based on SNAP version 8.
Downloaders for different operating systems can be obtained from the `official webpage <https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/>`_.

The following code can be used to replicate the software installation on a Linux OS:

::

    VERSION=8
    TARGET=~/SNAP"$VERSION"

    INSTALLER=esa-snap_sentinel_unix_"$VERSION"_0.sh
    wget https://download.esa.int/step/snap/"$VERSION".0/installers/"$INSTALLER"
    bash $INSTALLER -q -dir $TARGET
    $TARGET/bin/snap --nosplash --nogui --modules --update-all
